# Deep Q-Learning with Open AI Gym's Cart Pole Environment

In this notebook, an implementation of the deep-q-learning algorithm will be show step-by-step in order to balance a cartpole given that the AI can move right or left. The agent has to accumilate a reward of 195+ points across 100 episodes in order to win the game. This implementation of Deep-Q-Learning achieves a score of 500+ consistently after around 3000 episodes.

To learn more about Deep-Q-Learning, check out my medium article where I provide an intuitive approach to understand this algorithm:
