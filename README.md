# Deep Q-Learning with Open AI Gym's Cart Pole Environment

In this notebook, an implementation of the deep-q-learning algorithm will be show step-by-step in order to balance a cartpole given that the AI can move right or left. The agent has to accumilate a reward of 195+ points across 100 episodes in order to win the game. However, because of the restraints of Deep-Q-Learning, the highest reward attained by this model is around 187. Through parameter tuning, more optimal results can be achieved.
